This weather dashboard displays the current-day weather and five-day forecast weather based on city name input from users. The UV indicator is highlighted by background color showing favorable (green), moderate (orange), or severe (red) conditions.  Cities that have been previously searched are stored and displayed on the page.  Upon click of the city name, its weather information will automatically reload.
